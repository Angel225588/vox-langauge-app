## 🎯 Active Tasks for Gemini

### Task 0: Create New Mini-Game Card Components ⚡ HIGH PRIORITY

**Why Critical**: While Claude fixes the build blockers (React downgrade, TypeScript errors, tests), you can work in parallel to create new mini-game card components. This will save us hours of development time.

**Context**: We have 6 existing card components. We need 8+ new mini-game variations that Gemini AI will use as tools to dynamically compose personalized lessons.

**Reference Documents**:
- Read `docs/CARD_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - See how existing cards are structured
- Follow the pattern of existing cards in `/components/cards/`

**Your Mission**: Create the following new card components (DO THEM IN THIS ORDER):

#### Priority 1: Foundational Exercises (Create These First)

**1. SentenceScrambleCard.tsx**
**2. FillInBlankCard.tsx**
**3. DescribeImageCard.tsx**

*(Details omitted for brevity - see original task list below)*

### Task 1: Fix Database Sync Logic Testing (IN PROGRESS)

**Why Critical**: Database sync is the riskiest part of the app.
**Status**: Test file created, but needs more test cases and `it.todo` items to be completed.

---

### Task 3: Update Gemini Staircase Prompt with Motivation Data

**Context**: We added a motivation screen that collects user's deep motivations. The Gemini prompt needs to be updated to use this data for better personalization.
**File to Update**: `/lib/gemini/staircase-generator.ts`

---

### Task 4: Database Schema Update for Motivation Data

**What to Do**: Update the database schema and the API code to save the new `motivation_data` collected during onboarding.
**File to Update**: `/lib/api/staircases.ts`

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Do After Above

### Task 5: Progress Tracking Tests

**Files**: `/hooks/useProgress.ts`, `/lib/db/progress.ts`

### Task 6: Component Tests

**Components to Test**:
- `/components/cards/SpeakingCard.tsx`
- `/components/games/MultipleChoiceCard.tsx`
- `/components/shared/StreakDisplay.tsx`

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have

### Task 7: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` for automated testing on push/PR

### Task 8: Increase Test Coverage

Goal: Reach 70% coverage across the codebase

---
## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 2: Authentication Flow Testing
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**File created**: `__tests__/hooks/useAuth.test.ts`
**Details**: All major authentication flows (sign up, sign in, sign out, session persistence, error handling) are now covered by automated tests.
